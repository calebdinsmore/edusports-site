## Overview

### What is this?

The concept behind a fantasy title belt is simple: unlike a traditional championship title, which is won via a tournament bracket, the title belt is won simply by beating the current belt holder in a matchup.

There is no physical manifestation of the belt (yet), but the current belt holder will have a neat icon next to their name in the [current standings](/misc/standings.html).

### Does it matter?

Nope! But does any of this, really?

This is just a fun thing to add an extra bit of interest in regular matchups during the regular season.

### Who starts with it?

Because I'm the Commissioner, and what I write on this website is law, I have chosen **myself** as the initial owner of the Title Belt. I won the championship in the redraft last year, so I figure it makes sense.
