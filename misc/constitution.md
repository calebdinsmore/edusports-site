# Article I - Commissioner

### Section 1 - Responsibilities

The commissioner of the EduSports Fantasy Football League ("ESFFL") will be responsible for running the day-to-day operations of the ESFFL and ensuring a smooth, fair, and fun league experience.

### Section 2 - Current Commissioner

Caleb Dinsmore

# Article II - League Entry and Other Fees

### Section 1 - League Entry

At this time there are no fees associated with joining the league.

# Article III - Trading

### Section 1 - Trade Review

This league does not enforce a window within which to review pending trades. Owners are able to use traded players immediately upon acceptance of the trade by both parties.

### Section 2 - Vetoes/Overturning (Collusion Clause)

There is no review period for pending trades, so there is no standard process of vetoing a trade prior to it taking effect.

However, there are some cases in which a trade may be overturned. The two causes for overturning a trade are as follows:

- Collusion
- Cases of extreme lopsided trades that suggest collusion

Collusion is defined as:

> The coordinated actions of two or more owners with the intention of affecting the outcome of a game, the season, or the league in some way.

An example of collusion is if one owner A had given up hope of winning the season and wanted another owner B to win. Owner A could then propose a trade offering a highly valued player in exchange for a significantly less valuable player or players.

Another example of collusion would be two owners agreeing to trade players in coordination with those players' bye weeks with the intention to trade them back after the bye weeks had passed.

---

These types of trades break the spirit of the game and hurt the experience, so they will not be tolerated.

To overturn a trade, another owner in the league must petition the other owners and make a case for why a trade constitutes possible collusion or is so lopsided that it would severely impact parity. **Overturning trades should be very rare.** 

Once the owners involved in the trade have made a defense for why the trade should stand, a vote will be held amongst the owners in the league. For a trade to be overturned, the following criteria must be met:

- A two-thirds supermajority of the league must agree that the trade should be overturned
- The commissioner has approved the motion
    - In cases when the commissioner is involved in the trade, this criterion need not be met.

> It is worth emphasizing here that overturning trades should be a rare occurrence. Teams in a rebuild should be allowed to, for example, trade stud players away for future draft picks or future prospects.

### Section 3 - Deadline

The deadline for trading is Week 10 of the regular season. After this point trading is locked and teams may only augment rosters via the waiver wire.

# Article IV - Divisions

### Section 1 - Configuration

This league will consist of four divisions, each containing three teams.

### Section 2 - Determination

For the inaugural year of the league, the divisions will be determined at random.

Every three years, the league may realign divisions. The process for doing so is as follows:

- The top four teams by points-scored (accumulated during the past three years) would each draft their respective division.
- The draft type for this draft would be a snake draft.

Each division leader would then get to choose their division's name and avatar image.

### Section 3 - Scheduling

Once divisions have been decided, the regular season schedule will be configured by the commissioner. It will follow this format:

- For the first two weeks of the regular season, each team will face a division rival.
- For weeks 3 through 11, each team will play a team outside their division (only once per season).
- For weeks 12 and 13, each team will face a division rival for the second time.

# Article V - Playoffs

### Section 1 - Configuration

This league will implement a six-team Championship playoff bracket. The top six teams will be decided as follows:

- 1st Seed - Division winner with the best record among the division winners
- 2nd Seed - Division winner with the second best record among the division winners
- 3rd Seed - Division winner with the third best record among the division winners
- 4th Seed - Division winner with the worst record among the division winners
- 5th Seed - Wild card. Best overall record among remaining teams
- 6th Seed - Wild card. Most points scored in the regular season among remaining teams

Record ties will be broken by points-scored over the regular season.

### Section 2 - Championship Bracket

The top six teams will compete in a single-elimination bracket to determine the league champion.

The winner of the bracket will receive the coveted EduSports FFL Champion trophy to possess for the year until the conclusion of the following season.

The previous year's champion is responsible for delivery of the trophy to the new champion, including any shipping costs associated with delivery.

### Section 3 - First Round Semi-BYE

Instead of a traditional first-round BYE where the top two seeds do not play, they instead play against each other in a non-elimination match.

This non-elimination match grants an advantage to the winner, where the winner can decide which of the two winners of the 3rd-6th seed first-round games they wish to compete against in the semi-finals.

The winner of the non-elimination match must give the commissioner his/her decision no later than 48 hours prior to the first kickoff of Week 15.

The Semi-BYE is also in effect for the consolation bracket (see Section 4).

### Section 4 - Consolation Bracket (Toilet Bowl)

The bottom six teams will compete in a consolation bracket to determine who is the best of the worst.

This bracket will be structured identically to the playoff bracket, with winners advancing to the next round and competing in a "championship" matchup during Week 16.

The overall winner of the consolation bracket will be crowned the King of Poo and receive the Toilet Bowl trophy, which they will possess until the end of the next season.

The previous year's King of Poo is responsible for the delivery of the trophy to the new King of Poo.

The bottom finisher in the league overall must compensate the incumbent King of Poo for any shipping costs associated with delivery (standard shipping).

### Section 5 - Scoring Ties

This league uses fractional scoring, down to the hundredth decimal place, so score ties should be an extreme rarity.

In the event of a tie to the hundredth decimal place, the winner will be decided by taking the median of the individual scores of every player in each team's starting roster. The team with the higher median will be declared the winner.

In the event that the medians are also identical, benched players will be pulled into the calculation, and the higher median will be victorious. 

# Article VI - Determining Draft Order

### Section 1 - The Inaugural Draft

The draft order for the inaugural draft will be decided at random by the league hosting platform.

### Section 2 - Subsequent Drafts

Each year, the draft order will be determined by the results of the previous season.

Teams that did not make the playoffs will receive picks 1-6 in inverse order of regular season standings (i.e. worst team picks first).

Teams that did make the playoffs will receive picks 7-12 in inverse order of where they finished in the playoffs (i.e. Champion picks last).

# Article VII - Roster

### Section 1 - Composition

Each team's roster will consist of the following positions:

- 1 QB
- 2 WR
- 2 RB
- 2 FLEX (WR/RB/TE)
- 1 K
- 2 DL
- 2 LB
- 2 DB
- 1 FLEX (IDP)
- 27 BN

Therefore, roster sizes will max out at 42 spots.

### Section 2 - Injured Reserve

Each team will be allotted three IR spots, with suspensions counting as IR.

### Section 3 - Taxi Squad

Each team can have a maximum of five players on a taxi squad.

Incoming rookies must be placed on the taxi squad prior to the start of the regular season.

Players may only remain on the taxi squad for up to 3 years, after which point they must be activated or dropped.

# Article VIII - Roster Regulations

### Section 1 - Mandatory Rostering

Owners are forbidden from leaving more than one roster spot open (unfilled or filled by a player on their BYE or filled by a player not currently playing for an NFL team).

Owners are allotted one open roster spot before getting penalized (see Section 3 below).

### Section 2 - Commissioner Intervention

If an owner has a starting roster slot open (either due to a bye week or other oversight) but has a backup player (not on bye or OUT) available on their bench, then the Commissioner must insert the available player in the open roster slot. If two eligible players exist, then the player with the highest projected point output for that week should be inserted.

This section exists to ensure that oversights do not unfairly advantage the opponent.

The Commissioner will not make a substitution for a player who is declared OUT, regardless of when they were declared as such. The only exception is in cases when a roster is illegal, in which case substitutions must be made.

### Section 3 - No Substitutions Available

If an owner has more than one roster slot open with no viable substitutions available on their bench, the following penalty procedure will be carried out:

- First offense: public shaming in league communication channels
- Second offense: owner's team will receive 0 points for the week and a loss.
- Third offense and up: possible expulsion from the league at commissioner's discretion.

# Article X - Creating New League Rules

### Section 1 - Disputes

When a league dispute arises which has not been addressed within this Constitution, a discussion will be held on possible resolutions to the dispute. Based on this discussion, the Commissioner will create an online poll so that owners can vote on the appropriate course of action.

Based on the results of the poll, the league will follow the course of action receiving the majority of votes. The Commissioner will make the necessary changes to this Constitution based on the league's decision and make the league aware of those changes.

### Section 2 - Scoring Changes

Scoring rules are managed within the league hosting platform and will be final after the inaugural draft is held.

Proposed changes to these rules must be passed with an unanimous vote held in the off-season. Historical records will not be retroactively updated with any changes made.

### Section 3 - Roster Changes

Changes to Article VII must be proposed during the off-season.

In order for a proposed change to pass, the motion must be approved by a two-thirds supermajority vote.

### Section 4 - Other Changes

Any other changes not detailed above may be proposed at any time. The process for proposing and passing a change is as follows:

- Any owner may make a motion at any time to amend this Constitution.
- Another owner must second the motion.
- The Commissioner must approve the motion and begin the voting process.
  - The Commissioner may veto a motion to amend the Constitution. This veto may be overturned if one-third of the league is in favor of moving forward (4/12 owners). If four owners make known their approval of the motion, the Commissioner is compelled to move forward.
- The Commissioner will open a poll to the rest of the league within the Slack channel.
  - This poll will have a set voting period of seven days.

Amendments to the Constitution must be passed by a two-thirds supermajority vote (8/12 votes in favor). Exceptions to this rule are the following:

- Scoring (changes must be approved unanimously)
