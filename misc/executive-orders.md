In light of the unprecedented tumult of the 2020 season, I'm creating this page to track my "executive orders," which are basically the decisions I make to ensure a good experience for owners in the league despite COVID's best efforts to thwart us.

## Checks and Balances

I'm creating this document instead of amending the league constitution, since these have taken effect without an official league vote out of necessity. Further, these EOs likely will only be relevant this season. Of course, these (or more generalized versions of them) can be officially codified into the Constitution at any point according to the process laid out in [Article XII Section 4](https://edusports.us/misc/constitution.html#article-xii---creating-new-league-rules) and would thus be permanently effective unless repealed.

Should members of the league deem any of these unfair or undesired, overturning any one of them is simple:

- If five owners express that an order should be overturned, it is revoked immediately. The reasoning behind this number is that five opposed would be all that's needed to halt the passage of an amendment to the Constitution.
- The Commissioner may also revoke them at any time without the need for a vote.

# Team Autopilot Protocol

## Justification of Powers

To justify the powers being exercised in this order, I'm citing the following from the league Constitution:

**Article I Section 1**

> The commissioner of the EduSports Fantasy Football League ("ESFFL") will be responsible for running the day-to-day operations of the ESFFL and ensuring a smooth, **fair**, and fun league experience.

**Article IX Section 3**

> If an owner has more than one roster slot open with no viable substitutions available on their bench, the following penalty procedure will be carried out:
>
> - First offense: public shaming in league communication channels
> - Second offense: owner's team will receive 0 points for the week and a loss.
> - **Third offense and up: possible expulsion from the league at commissioner's discretion.**

### Details

Pursuant to my responsibility to ensure a fair league experience and my authority to expel members at my discretion from the league as a consequence of prolonged inactivity/failure to maintain their team to a minimum standard, I'm issuing this order which lays out a new "autopilot" protocol to be used when members fail to demonstrate active participation during the course of the regular season.

"Failure to demonstrate active participation" is a standard met if a majority of the following criteria are met:

- An illegal roster has not been fixed for a week or more, requiring Commissioner intervention
- No communication in league channels (messaging, voting in polls, etc.) for a month or more
- Failure to respond to direct pings that require action multiple times
- Commissioner intervention has been necessitated

# Illegal Roster Corrections

### Details

In cases where a roster is illegal, and the owner has not taken steps to remedy the issue, the Commissioner has the authority to fix the roster at their discretion.

If resolving the issue requires dropping players from the roster (after IR and Taxi slots have been filled), the Commissioner will prioritize drops from the bench using the following criteria:

- Non-rookies (i.e. not drafted this year)
- Lowest `Roster %`
- Lowest `Start %`
- Coin flip

#### Expires: _Does not expire_

# COVID-19 IR Eligibility

> Initially expiring after the 2020 championship game, this policy has been extended to the 2022 championship game

### Details

During the 2020 season, players that have opted out or have been quarantined due to COVID-19 are IR-eligible. At this time, the number of IR spots has not increased.

#### Expires: _After the 2022 Week 17 Championship_

# Game Postponement Insurance

> Initially expiring after the 2020 championship game, this policy has been extended to the 2022 championship game

### Details

Because of the constantly changing scheduling of NFL games due to COVID, an insurance process is effective this season enabling an owner to confidently set their lineup with little fear of COVID completely losing them a game. Here's how it works:

- If a player on an owner's roster is at risk of a postponed game, that owner may set that player's nickname to the name of a valid replacement on their roster.
  - This must be done prior to first kickoff on Sunday of that week. Players that played earlier in the week (e.g. Thursday night) are ineligible unless the nickname was set prior to the kickoff of that player's game.
- If a player in the owner's starting lineup does not play due to a postponed game, the following process takes place:
  - If that player's nickname corresponds to a valid replacement on the owner's bench, the Commissioner will replace that starting player with the named replacement.
  - If the player's nickname does not correspond to a valid replacement (or is missing entirely) and the official declaration of the game cancellation happened on Sunday or later, the Commissioner will replace that player with the valid replacement whose projected points total is the highest.

This should hopefully provide enough flexibility for owners so that teams don't win or lose purely because of unforeseen game cancellations.

#### Expires: _After the 2022 Week 17 Championship_
