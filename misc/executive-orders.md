In light of the unprecedented tumult of the 2020 season, I'm creating this page to track my "executive orders," which are basically the decisions I make to ensure a good experience for owners in the league despite COVID's best efforts to thwart us.

## Checks and Balances

I'm creating this document instead of amending the league constitution, since these have taken effect without an official league vote out of necessity. Further, these EOs likely will only be relevant this season. Of course, these (or more generalized versions of them) can be officially codified into the Constitution at any point according to the process laid out in [Article XII Section 4](https://edusports.us/misc/constitution.html#article-xii---creating-new-league-rules) and would thus be permanently effective unless repealed.

Should members of the league deem any of these unfair or undesired, overturning any one of them is simple:

- If five owners express that an order should be overturned, it is revoked immediately. The reasoning behind this number is that five opposed would be all that's needed to halt the passage of an amendment to the Constitution.
- The Commissioner may also revoke them at any time without the need for a vote.

# Illegal Roster Corrections

### Details

In cases where a roster is illegal, and the owner has not taken steps to remedy the issue, the Commissioner has the authority to fix the roster at their discretion.

If resolving the issue requires dropping players from the roster, the Commissioner will prioritize drops from the bench using the following criteria, with each point after the first used to break ties:

- Lowest `Roster %`
- Lowest `Start %`
- Coin flip

#### Expires: _Does not expire_

# COVID-19 IR Eligibility

# Game Postponement Insurance

> Initially expiring after the 2020 championship game, this policy has been extended to the 2021 championship game

### Details

Because of the constantly changing scheduling of NFL games due to COVID, an insurance process is effective this season enabling an owner to confidently set their lineup with little fear of COVID completely losing them a game. Here's how it works:

- If a player on an owner's roster is at risk of a postponed game, that owner may set that player's nickname to the name of a valid replacement on their roster.
  - This must be done prior to first kickoff on Sunday of that week. Players that played earlier in the week (e.g. Thursday night) are ineligible unless the nickname was set prior to the kickoff of that player's game.
- If a player in the owner's starting lineup does not play due to a postponed game, the following process takes place:
  - If that player's nickname corresponds to a valid replacement on the owner's bench, the Commissioner will replace that starting player with the named replacement.
  - If the player's nickname does not correspond to a valid replacement (or is missing entirely) and the official declaration of the game cancellation happened on Sunday or later, the Commissioner will replace that player with the valid replacement whose projected points total is the highest.

This should hopefully provide enough flexibility for owners so that teams don't win or lose purely because of unforeseen game cancellations.

#### Expires: _After the 2022 Week 17 Championship_
