It's the last week of the regular season, and while the division seeds have been locked up, a lot can happen with the wild cards. Let's dig into it!

# Playoff Picture

### Clinched Seeds

- Tricksters: Clinched the #1 seed
- Kali Warriors: Clinched the #2 seed
- Not Lucky: Clinched either the #3/#4 seed
- Winged Hussars: Clinched either #3/#4 seed

### Mathematically eliminated:

- Pegasus

## Monte Carlo Simulation

As usual, I've run a Monte Carlo sim of Rivalry Week, simulating 100,000 outcomes.

Matches are simulated using randomly generated scores sampled from a normal distribution based on each team's performance this season.

Here are the results (sorted by total probability):

| Team                | 1       | 2       | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      | Total   |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Tricksters          | 100.00% | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 100.00% |
| Kali Warriors       | 0.00%   | 100.00% | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 100.00% |
| Not Lucky           | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 90.14% | 9.86%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 100.00% |
| Winged Hussars      | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 9.86%  | 90.14% | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 100.00% |
| Bling Bling         | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 85.68% | 85.68%  |
| Necessary Roughness | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 71.73% | 0.00%  | 71.73%  |
| Red Warriors        | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 22.24% | 12.32% | 34.56%  |
| Detroit Wolverines  | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 3.14%  | 1.30%  | 4.44%   |
| speed-demons        | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 2.88%  | 0.70%  | 3.58%   |
| Golden Eagles       | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.01%  | 0.00%  | 0.01%   |
| The Death Eaters    | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.001% | 0.001%  |
| Pegasus             | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%  | 0.00%   |

### Highlights

- In 100,000 simulations, The Death Eaters took the #6 seed exactly once. For this to happen, they need to both get around their season-high 219 points, and every other contender needs to have cripplingly bad games. But _there is a chance._
- This illustrates how crucial the #6 seed is to helping out unlucky teams. Despite currently being 5-8 (#10 by record), Bling Bling has a very good shot at making it into the playoffs because of their overall good performance (75-68 overall wins).

# Teams in the Hunt

Here are the teams in the hunt for a playoff seed (of which there are many) and what they need to happen in order to secure a shot at the championship.

## Teams Likely to Lock it Up

> In the "Competition, ranked by threat" list, percentages in parentheses refer to the probability of getting the contested seed, not total probability

### Bling Bling (5-8 \| 2121.7 \| 85.68% Total Prob)

**Seed they're gunning for:** #6

**Competition, ranked by threat:**

1. Red Warriors (2071.18 \| 12.32%)
2. Detroit Wolverines (2039.1 1.3%)
3. speed-demons (2027.28 \| 0.7%)
4. The Death Eaters (1946.04 \| 0.001%)

#### What they need

- They are 50.52 points ahead of their biggest competition, so they just need to not score 50.53 fewer points than the Red Warriors, and they've pretty much locked it up.

### Necessary Roughness (7-6 \| 2075.84 \| 71.73% Total Prob)

**Seed they're gunning for:** #5

**Competition, ranked by threat:**

1. Red Warriors (6-7 \| 2071.18)
2. Detroit Wolverines (6-7 \| 2039.1)
3. speed-demons (6-7 \| 2027.28)
4. Golden Eagles (6-7 \| 1958.8)

#### What they need

- A win. Winning their game against rival Bling Bling would secure the #5 seed, since their 8-6 record would be unmatched.
- If they lose, they need:
  - Red Warriors to lose or win and score no more than 4.66 points than they do.
  - Detroit Wolverines to lose or win and score no more than 36.74 points than they do.
  - speed-demons to lose or win and score no more than 48.56 points than they do.
  - Golden Eagles to lose or win and score no more than 117.04 points than they do.

## Long Shots

Here are the teams with a long shot at a playoff spot.

### Red Warriors (6-7 \| 2071.18 \| 34.56%)

#### Their miracle

To secure a playoff spot against the odds, they need the following to happen:

**More Likely (#5 Seed \| 22.24%):**

- Secure a win against the Golden Eagles.
- Necessary Roughness must lose the game they are currently favored to win.
- Score 4.67 more points than Necessary Roughness and maintain their points lead over other potentially 7-7 teams.

**Less Likely (#6 Seed \| 12.32%):**

- Score at least 50.53 points more than Bling Bling (plus any additional if another team in the hunt scores enough to top Bling Bling).

### Detroit Wolverines (6-7 \| 2039.1 \| 4.44%)

#### Their miracle

To secure a playoff spot against the odds, they need the following to happen:

**More Likely (#5 Seed \| 3.14%)**

- Secure a win against the Tricksters (easier said than done).
- Necessary Roughness must lose the game they are currently favored to win.
- Score at least 36.75 points more than Necessary Roughness.

**Less Likely (#6 Seed \| 1.3%)**

- Score at least 82.7 points more than Bling Bling (plus any additional if another team in the hunt scores enough to top Bling Bling).

### speed-demons (6-7 \| 2027.28 \| 3.58%)

#### Their miracle

To secure a playoff spot against the odds, they need the following to happen:

**More Likely (#5 Seed \| 2.88%)**

- Secure a win against the Kali Warriors.
- Necessary Roughness must lose the game they are currently favored to win.
- Score at least 48.57 points more than Necessary Roughness.

**Less Likely (#6 Seed \| 0.7%)**

- Score at least 94.43 points more than Bling Bling (plus any additional if another team in the hunt scores enough to top Bling Bling).

### Golden Eagles (6-7 \| 1958.8 \| 0.01%)

**More Likely (#5 Seed \| 0.01%)**

- Secure a win against Red Warriors.
- Necessary Roughness must lose the game they are currently favored to win.
- Score at least 117.05 points more than Necessary Roughness.

**Basically Impossible (#6 Seed \| ~ 0.001%)>)**

- Score at least 162.91 points more than Bling Bling (plus any additional if another team in the hunt scores enough to top Bling Bling).

### The Death Eaters (3-10 \| 1946.04 \| ~ 0.001%)

**Basically Impossible (#6 Seed \| ~ 0.001%)**

- Score at least 175.67 points more than Bling Bling (plus any additional if another team in the hunt scores enough to top Bling Bling).
- Probably the only reason this happened in the simulation but a #6 seed didn't happen for Golden Eagles is that TDE's season high is 10 points more than GE's.

And that's the playoff picture! Good luck to all teams in the hunt: may the TDs be ever in your favor.
