After an explosive week for fantasy is officially in the books, it's time again to check in on the status of the league.

## Weekly Status Update

### Current Playoff Seeds

If the playoff seeds were calculated today, here's who would make the cut.

| Seed | Team Name        | Criteria                                  |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1st  | Bling Bling      | Division winner with best record\*        |
| 2nd  | Pegasus          | Division winner with second-best record\* |
| 3rd  | Kali Warriors    | Division winner with third-best record\*  |
| 4th  | Tricksters       | Division winner with worst record\*       |
| 5th  | Not Lucky        | Team with best record among remaining\*   |
| 6th  | Total domination | Team with most points for among remaining |

\*Ties broken by **Points For**.

Most notable change here is that Total domination is currently in contention for the points-based wild card seed.

### Title Belt

Team **Not Lucky** successfully defended his title and is holding the belt for the second week in a row!

### Scoring by Division

| Rank | Division Name    | Points For | Wins | Average PPG |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1    | Division By Zero | 2681.40    | 9    | 178.76      |
| 2    | High Flyers      | 2522.38    | 8    | 168.16      |
| 3    | The Resistance   | 2450.26    | 6    | 163.35      |
| 4    | Cerberus         | 2365.64    | 7    | 157.71      |

Total domination's and Kali Warriors' big performances weren't enough to carry Cerberus out of the bottom rung on the divisional ladder. Division By Zero continues to be absolutely dominant (mostly--sorry, Wolverines).

### Points Leaders

#### Points For

| Rank | Team Name           | Points For | Change | Points Behind Lead | Points Behind Next Rank |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |

| 2    | Not Lucky           | 954.96     | 0      | 14.22              | 14.22                   |
| 3    | Pegasus             | 940.26     | -2     | 28.92              | 14.70                   |
| 4    | Kali Warriors       | 886.80     | 1      | 82.38              | 53.46                   |
| 5    | Tricksters          | 869.86     | -1     | 99.32              | 16.94                   |
| 6    | Total Domination    | 834.82     | 2      | 134.36             | 35.04                   |
| 7    | speed-demons        | 831.42     | -1     | 137.76             | 3.40                    |
| 8    | Golden Eagles       | 796.68     | 2      | 172.50             | 34.74                   |
| 9    | Winged Hussars      | 785.44     | -2     | 183.74             | 11.24                   |
| 10   | Detroit Wolverines  | 757.26     | 1      | 211.92             | 28.18                   |
| 11   | Necessary Roughness | 748.98     | -2     | 220.20             | 8.28                    |
| 12   | Red Warriors        | 644.02     | 0      | 325.16             | 104.96                  |

The **Points Behind Next Rank** column really helps illustrate the gap between what I'm dubbing the **Big 3** and their competition. The Big 3 are pretty close to each other, but the #4 team, Kali Warriors, trails Pegasus by 53 points. That gap can be closed in a single week, but it's the second largest gap between teams behind the Red Warriors' astonishing 104-point gap behind Necessary Roughness.

#### Max Points For

I don't really value this stat too much, since it's skewed by anomalous boom weeks by inconsistent players on your bench, so I'm not going to include as much detail as the above table.

| Rank | Team Name           | Max PF  |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------- |
| 1    | Not Lucky           | 1215.82 |
| 2    | speed-demons        | 1144.82 |
| 3    | Tricksters          | 1106.16 |
| 4    | Bling Bling         | 1103.86 |
| 5    | Kali Warriors       | 1097.38 |
| 6    | Pegasus             | 1074.56 |
| 7    | Detroit Wolverines  | 1071.54 |
| 8    | Winged Hussars      | 1025.54 |
| 9    | Total Domination    | 980.30  |
| 10   | Golden Eagles       | 976.06  |
| 11   | Necessary Roughness | 932.90  |
| 12   | Red Warriors        | 920.40  |

### Manager Ranking

Here's a new metric tracking how well you've been managing your roster over the season. The grade is purely what percentage of your Max PF you've been able to successfully use.

The unfortunate thing about the Red Warriors is that they not only have the lowest total Max PF but they also have been the least efficient at managing their team. Fatal combination.

| Rank | Team Name           | Points For | Max PF  | Manager Grade |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1    | Bling Bling         | 969.18     | 1103.86 | 87.80%        |
| 2    | Pegasus             | 940.26     | 1074.56 | 87.50%        |
| 3    | Total Domination    | 834.82     | 980.30  | 85.16%        |
| 4    | Golden Eagles       | 796.68     | 976.06  | 81.62%        |
| 5    | Kali Warriors       | 886.80     | 1097.38 | 80.81%        |
| 6    | Necessary Roughness | 748.98     | 932.90  | 80.29%        |
| 7    | Tricksters          | 869.86     | 1106.16 | 78.64%        |
| 8    | Not Lucky           | 954.96     | 1215.82 | 78.54%        |
| 9    | Winged Hussars      | 785.44     | 1025.54 | 76.59%        |
| 10   | speed-demons        | 831.42     | 1144.82 | 72.62%        |
| 11   | Detroit Wolverines  | 757.26     | 1071.54 | 70.67%        |
| 12   | Red Warriors        | 644.02     | 920.40  | 69.97%        |

This week didn't see any dramatic changes in rank--just some light jostling among the lower tiers. The Big 3 are still dominant and remain unchanged. I expect Not Lucky to move up past Pegasus in the coming week if that team keeps performing.

Interesting notes on this chart:

-   The speed-demons have had the most erratic trajectory so far, starting the season at 8, rocketing to 1, and then slowly meandering back down to 7.
-   Pegasus has seen the most dramatic turn-around in power ranking from the start of the season to present, beginning the season at #10, rocketing up to #3, and cementing at #2, where they've sat for the past 3 weeks.

## Team-by-Team Breakdown

### Bling Bling (1)

There really isn't much to say here that hasn't been said. This team is incredibly dominant. Their biggest struggles lie at the QB position--I mean, the owner is streaming Devlin Hodges, which I think says it all. Of course, does Bling Bling _really_ need a QB?

### Pegasus (2)

Even though Pegasus sits at #2, they aren't really close to jostling Bling Bling for the #1 spot. The gap between Bling Bling and his competition in terms of overall power at the moment is pretty wide.

Pegasus sits atop their division fairly comfortably--their closest competition is the Golden Eagles, which don't quite pose a threat yet.

### Not Lucky (3)

## Luck Chart

![](/post-assets/2019-10-04/luck.png)

This week the Golden Eagles take the crown as the luckiest team in the league. Based on the moves they're making, they're aiming to turn their good fortune into a 2019 playoff run. Looking forward to seeing how it pans out--wouldn't be the first time an Eagles team were underdogs and came out on top. 😉
