## Power Rankings

The following rankings factor into the calculation how your team has scored to date, your overall record (what your record would be if you played every other team every week), and how good your roster is in the aggregated opinion of fantasy experts.

### Definitions

Here are some definitions for some potentially obscure columns.

- **CHANGE**
  - This column is how your power rank has changed since last week. That column for this week is comparing your current power ranking with the power ranking of your draft results.
- **OVERALL WINS**
  - This column is your current record if you played every other team every week. So, if you scored the highest (Pegasus) your overall wins record would be undefeated. If you scored the lowest (Red Warriors), your record would have 0 wins.
- **R.O.S. Roster**
  - This is the current strength of your roster relative to other leaguemates.
  - This is derived from the FantasyPros website, which evaluates the strength of players by aggregating different fantasy expert opinions.

## Lucky/Unlucky Teams

![](/post-assets/2019-09-11-week-1-recap/1-luck-chart.png){:.rounded}

This table measures how "lucky" (or otherwise) your team is. It takes your **overall** record (if you played every other team each week) and compares it with your **actual** record. A higher percentage in the **Difference** column indicates that your team was lucky to have the matchup it did, and a lower percentage indicates that your team was very unfortunate to have the matchup it did.

Hilariously enough, the unluckiest team this week/to date is Lucky. Despite scoring 20 points above the league average and putting up better points than 82% of their leaguemates, Lucky lost by playing the highest scoring team of the week.

Feels bad man.
