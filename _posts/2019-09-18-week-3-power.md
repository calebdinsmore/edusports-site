Happy Wednesday! It's time for the weekly power rankings, where I judge everyone's worth and at the end you cry at how unlucky your matchups have been.

## Power Rankings Table

**Reference:**
- **OVERALL WINS:** Current record if the team played every other team every week.
- **R.O.S. Roster:** Current rank of the team's roster (aggregated expert opinions).
- **CONS:** Consistency ranking based on a Sharpe ratio of each team's scores each week. Does not currently factor into power rank because of the small sample size.

## Team-by-Team Breakdown

### Bling Bling (#1)

Bling Bling has come out of the gate with a very strong showing. Matched in overall wins only by Not Lucky, their stacked RB corps and stout defensive players have delivered strong performances the first two weeks of the season. They're currently sitting in 3rd in PPG, but they score highly the most consistently (across two games, but still).

If they can remedy their current lackluster QB situation, they should be in great shape to dominate the rest of this season. Bling Bling might be currently leading their division, but Not Lucky is poised to turn things around and could give Bling a run for the division title.

### Kali Warriors (#2)

Not to toot my own horn, but my team is pretty neat. Because of my (not sarcastic) unfortunate pick positioning at first overall in the draft, I couldn't grab more than one top-tier offensive player. That player is Saquon, so I'm not complaining _that_ much. Anyway, because of my placement as the first pick, I adjusted my strategy to focus on snatching up top players in the defensive positions and make do with great but less consistent WRs--a draft strategy which I think has been paying off. That said, this past week a large portion of my players popped off, and I don't necessarily anticipate being able to consistently hit this PPG ROS.

### Pegasus (#3)

Pegasus definitely shocked me (and Jason, I'm sure) with their Week 1 performance. I have a feeling Week 2 will be more indicative of what we can expect from Pegasus moving forward, especially with Alvin Kamara's value suffering a decent drop in the wake of Brees' injury. Time will tell.

### Tricksters (#4)

The last of the four currently undefeated teams, the Tricksters haven't had especially flashy games, but they've put up decent points, with an overall win percentage of 64% (14-8). With easily the most stacked WR corps in the league and mostly solid players filling out the other positions on both sides of the ball, they should continue to put up great numbers.

### speed-demons (#5)

The speed-demons took the sharpest plummet in PRs this week after a very lackluster performance in Week 2. The demons' roster shows a lot of potential (Elliot, Ingram, Montgomery, Engram, etc.), but after going 10-1 overall in Week 1, they went 3-8 in Week 2.

It's only been two weeks, of course, and I think the demons will manage to crawl their way back up the rankings. After losing to me in Week 3, of course.

### Not Lucky (#6)

Not Lucky have remained firmly in the middle of the pack, caught between the great numbers they've put up and the sad reality of going 0-2 despite having an overall record of 18-4.

There are certainly brighter days ahead, though--his next matchup is against the Detroit Wolverines, who currently occupy the #12 spot in these rankings. If he somehow loses that game...well, it would be great for the memes, at least.

### Total Domination (#7)

Total Domination might also consider a name change to Moderate Domination, after opening the season with a modest 157 PPG (6.2 below the league average). Total Domination currently stands the best chance at contending for the Cerberus division title, but they might need to make some moves to make that a reality.

### Winged Hussars (#8)

It's definitely worth watching the High Flyers division in the coming weeks, as the battle for divisional glory could be close there. I'm uncertain as to whether Pegasus's roster can sustain the PPG they're currently touting, and the Winged Hussars show some serious potential.

The biggest question marks to me in this roster are JuJu and Sony. These are two players with high ceilings, but with Big Ben out for the season and Sony showing less-than-spectacular running on tape, I'm curious as to how the value of these players may change in the coming weeks.

### Golden Eagles (#9)

I've already kind of made this joke, but I'll make it again. The Golden Eagles might also consider a name change to the Golden Geese, because four of their players laid some fat goose eggs this past week.

With Alshon out this next week--the same week the Golden Eagles are playing the #1 team in these rankings--and L. Murray becoming fantasy irrelevant in the wake of the Brees injury, the Golden Eagles are going to need to start looking at making moves if they want to be a contender this season.

### Necessary Roughness (#10)

Necessary Roughness have put up some not-the-worst-but-mediocre numbers this season. Like the rest of these bottom four, they will need to think carefully about the next few weeks and consider what strategy they want to employ for the rest of the season. Dynasty is all about making moves via trades, since you won't find as much hope on the waiver wire. The question that should be on Erik's mind (and on the minds of the owners of the other three teams occupying these bottom spots) is whether they should be targeting future potential or going all-in on a championship run this season.

### Red Warriors (#11)

The Red Warriors have had an abysmal past couple of weeks, only managing to put up better numbers than the bottom team in these rankings, scoring 32.8 points below the league's average PPG. There isn't a ton of promise on the bench, either. It's not looking good for the Warriors' prospects this season, and if things don't turn up, it might be wise to start shoring up future prospects.

### Detroit Wolverines (#12)

With an overall record of 1-21, things do not look great in Detroit. There's definitely promise in the roster; Aaron won "worst manager" this week for setting the worst line-up, with a maximum possible score of 188.7 points. However, the key to success in fantasy is consistency, and it'll be tough week-in and week-out to get close to your maximum possible point totals if the players on your roster don't put up consistent and reliable points.

There's a lot of potential on this roster, but the stars might not be aligned for this year.

## Matchup Luck Chart

![](/post-assets/2019-09-18/luck-chart.png){:.rounded}

There's something truly hilarious about the nice transition from green to orange for most of the Difference column and then 
:collision: dark red.

For the second straight week, (Not) Lucky has gone 9-2 in overall record but lost the matchup. There's a 55% gap between them and the next unluckiest team, Necessary Roughness. The good news for (Not) Lucky is that their next matchup is against the Wolverines, which should be an easy win *knock on wood*.

The Winged Hussars have had the fairest schedule, perfectly matching their total win percentage with their actual win percentage.

This table also serves to illustrate how dominant Bling Bling really is so far; among the four 2-0 teams, they are the team least helped along by Lady Luck.
