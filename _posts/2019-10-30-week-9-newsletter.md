### Observations

Two significant shake-ups happened after Week 8:
- The Detroit Wolverines and Not Lucky switched places, with the Wolverines rocketing up 4 places to #4 and Not Lucky plummeting back down 4 places to #8.
- Less dramatically, Necessary Roughness and Pegasus also switched places, with Necessary Roughness climbing 2 places to #7 and Pegasus dropping 2 down to #9.

Adding to that, Not Lucky and Pegasus are the first top-7 team since Week 5 to drop below #7. It's definitely been a rocky past few weeks for them.

The Red Warriors have managed to barely pull themselves out of the depths of #12--and I mean barely. The difference between the Warriors and the Hussars in terms of the score I calculate to determine PR is _very_ small. They've managed this mostly by luck; despite their 130PPG and only getting **_seven_** overall wins in the last five weeks, they did manage to defy the odds and get two *actual* wins in that time frame, putting their record at an improbable 3-5. The Hussars have just barely managed to do worse than them, which at least bodes well for their 2020 draft position!

### Observations

- Not Lucky has continued to sink, dropping to their lowest ROS Roster ranking of the season at #10. This largely comes as a result of Ekeler's diminished performance in the wake of Gordon's return (despite looking like a much better back for the Chargers), as well as Coleman's return hurting Breida's ROS outlook.

## Team-by-Team Breakdown

### Bling Bling (1)

| Team Name   | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Bling Bling | 7-1    | 1             | 71-17        | 1511.30    | 188.91 | 24.85              |

Bling Bling is just unfair. Their Week 8 starting QB was Teddy Bridgewater, a guy who didn't even start and ended up putting up negative points, and Bling Bling _still_ put up 200+ points and had the highest score for the week--second highest score in the league on the season.

Bling Bling plays the speed-demons this week, and I'm fairly confident it'll be another W for BB.

### Kali Warriors (2)

| Team Name     | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Kali Warriors | 5-3    | 1             | 59-29        | 1417.90    | 177.24 | 13.17              |

After a decisive victory over the declining Not Lucky, the Kali Warriors are back on top of their division. Total domination is nipping at their heels, but the Warriors have a significant Points For margin ahead of TD. As long as the Warriors can keep up the wins, they should be able to make it out ahead of TD in the division. But fantasy is a cruel mistress, and a couple unfortunate upsets could turn the tables really quickly.

### Tricksters (3)

| Team Name  | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Tricksters | 4-4    | 1             | 53-35        | 1364.38    | 170.55 | 6.48               |

In a fun turn of events, the entire Resistance division is 4-4, and among mediocrity, the Tricksters reign supreme. Theirs is a very fun division to watch--the division title is easily within every member's grasp. At this point, though, given their performance to date, it's difficult to see anyone taking the division title over the Tricksters when all is said and done.

This week the Tricksters face an easy matchup against the Winged Hussars, while the speed-demons and Necessary Roughness face much tougher foes: Bling Bling and Not Lucky, respectively. A key upset this week would put either divisional rival in a good position in the race for Resistance glory.

### Detroit Wolverines (4)

| Team Name          | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Detroit Wolverines | 4-4    | 3             | 45-43        | 1325.24    | 165.66 | 1.59               |

What a turnaround for the Wolverines. In weeks 3 and 4, they were ranked dead last and were looking like the worst team in the league. Over the past few weeks they have been dominant, notching up 43 overall wins, which is the second in the league for that time frame.

The unfortunate part for the Wolverines is that their only real hope at a playoff berth is securing a wild card seed. The Division by Zero title is all but secured in the hands of Bling Bling. As they ascend the Points For ranks, that 6th seed is looking more and more attainable, and there is a decent chance that every member of Division by Zero makes it into the playoffs.

### Total domination (5)

| Team Name        | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Total domination | 5-3    | 2             | 42-46        | 1304.10    | 163.01 | -1.05              |

Total domination's win streak came to an end in Week 8, as they lost to Bling Bling pretty handily. Bad luck can't really be blamed for the loss either, as their Week 8 overall win record was a sad `2-9`.

This week is looking up for them, though, as they face Pegasus, a team that hasn't looked formidable since Week 4. However, they'll need the Golden Eagles to pull out an upset against the Kali Warriors this week if they want to get back on top of the division.

### speed-demons (6)

| Team Name    | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| speed-demons | 4-4    | 2             | 46-42        | 1337.36    | 167.17 | 3.10               |

The speed-demons have had a very average season so far, and fortunately for them, so has their division. They're the most immediate threat to the Tricksters' divisional lead, and as the trade deadline appears over the horizon, it might be time to decide whether to make a move and commit to contention or to let the chips fall how they may.

### Necessary Roughness (7)

| Team Name           | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Necessary Roughness | 4-4    | 3             | 41-47        | 1310.76    | 163.85 | -0.22              |

At #7, Necessary Roughness is at the highest point in the power rankings

### Detroit Wolverines (8)

| Team Name          | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Detroit Wolverines | 3-4    | 3             | 36-41        | 1129.98    | 161.43 | -1.76              |

...No. What a comeback!

After sitting at #12 in the Power Rankings in Weeks 3 and 4, the Wolverines have slowly but steadily climbed the rankings after a string of impressive performances. Their PPG the past 4 weeks is 184.12, and they show no sign of slowing down. I fully expect to see them even higher up next week.

### Necessary Roughness (9)

| Team Name           | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Necessary Roughness | 3-4    | 3             | 33-44        | 1119.50    | 159.93 | -3.26              |

After weeks of bouncing between #10 and #11 in PR, Necessary Roughness has broken out of that depressing cycle and made it to #9!

They put up the highest score of the week last week, following up their great Week 6 performance nicely. A playoff berth still looks like a longshot, but their outlook looks a lot better than it did a couple weeks ago.

### Golden Eagles (10)

| Team Name     | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Golden Eagles | 3-4    | 2             | 28-49        | 1058.26    | 151.18 | -12.01             |

It's been a tough year for the Golden Eagles. They've sought to capitalize on some of their fortunate victories, but so far that effort hasn't yet translated into consistent success.

The good news for them is that their roster seems to have the potential (what with a 250+ max PF this past week or something ridiculous like that). The difficulty, as is always the case in fantasy, comes in picking which players to start.

I'm interested to see how this week shakes out against the recently formidable Necessary Roughness. They're only a game behind their division leader Pegasus, a team who seems to be crumbling right now, so clinching the division is still well within the realm of possibility for GE.

### Winged Hussars (11)

| Team Name      | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Winged Hussars | 1-6    | 3             | 28-49        | 1053.30    | 150.47 | -12.72             |

The Winged Hussars' involuntary tanking is going well--they hold the #11 spot in these rankings despite holding the worst record in the league.

After Patrick Mahomes awful injury in last week's TNF game, the Hussars' outlook looks bleaker than ever; on the plus side, however, it's looking like Mahomes won't be out long. Whether an earlier return will translate into better times for the Hussars, though, is looking pretty unlikely.

It doesn't look good for the Hussars' playoff hopes, but being in the High Flyers, the weakest division in the league, means they still have a shot.

### Red Warriors (12)

| Team Name    | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Red Warriors | 2-5    | 3             | 12-65        | 890.56     | 127.22 | -35.97             |

The Red Warriors got their second win last week against High Flyers division leader Pegasus! What an upset.

## Luck Chart

![](/post-assets/2019-10-25/luck.png){:.rounded}

Total domination's string of recent successes seems to have been aided at least mildly by luck, while the Winged Hussars continue to hold the crown for unluckiest team so far.

Necessary Roughness is right where they should be. There's something so satisfying about seeing 33-44 in Total Record and 3-4 in Actual Record.

On to the next week!
