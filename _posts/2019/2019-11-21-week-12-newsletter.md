With Total domination claiming the division lead in Cerberus, the competition for the #6 wildcard seed just got a lot more interesting. _So_ much hinges on whether Not Lucky claims the #5 wildcard seed at the end of the regular season.

### Observations

After weeks of comfortably sitting in the top 2, the Kali Warriors have plunged to #5, the lowest position they've been in since Week 5. A season-low performance and 2-week losing streak will do that.

The Detroit Wolverines have truly made a remarkable turnaround to dominance since being at #12 in Weeks 3 and 4. They're averaging 9.8 overall wins per week over the last 5 weeks (translation: on average they've been in the top-3 of scorers each week for the past 5 weeks)!

Pegasus has climbed back up a bit to #7 this week, which is an interesting position for the only team that's clinched a playoff spot. Despite Pegasus's dominant performance last week, the byes showed us just how flimsy that team's depth chart is, and with Marlon Mack out for a while (and the possibility of other injuries to key players always looming), there is every possibility that Pegasus makes a swift exit from the bracket come Week 14.

## Playoff Probabilities

### Methodology

I took the upcoming schedule and ran it through a Monte Carlo simulation, simulating 100,000 different regular season outcomes.

It's not sophisticated; it doesn't factor in upcoming BYE weeks or consider the different matchups players on each roster have that might produce extraordinary games.

Here's what it does right now:

-   Takes each team and computes a truncated mean and standard deviation for their point totals scored throughout the season.
    -   I'm truncating the scores by removing each team's lowest and highest score from the mean.
-   Goes through each week and simulates a matchup by generating a random score for each team in the matchup. This random score is generated assuming a normal distribution and is based on the truncated mean and standard deviation for the team.
-   After simulating the rest of the season, it calculates the playoff seeding for the results and records them.

Since it doesn't take future BYE weeks into account that would potentially factor into future upsets, it's obviously not a perfect simulation. But it **does** give you an idea for how difficult your coming schedule is.

### Probability Table

Quick note:

-   **Change** is the change in each team's Playoff Chance compared to when this was run last week.

#### Observations

- After upsetting (in multiple senses) division rival Kali Warriors last week, Total domination's playoff chances have increased dramatically.
- Meanwhile, the Kali Warriors' chances have continued to drop. After losing a key matchup against Total domination, the Kali Warriors are looking toward a wildcard seed as their best hope for a playoff berth.
- The Tricksters have the most tenuous grasp on their playoff dreams. They're hoping for a miracle.
- Fun fact: Bling Bling's exact playoff probability is at 99.991%, meaning that of the 100,000 simulated outcomes, there were 9 in which Bling Bling missed the playoffs entirely. I'm not a betting man, but I'd be willing to wager he'll make it in.

## Team by Team Breakdown - Paths to the Playoffs

In this section I'm going to focus on the teams that haven't yet secured a playoff spot and break down their most likely path to a shot at glory.

### Bling Bling (99.99%)

| Team Name   | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Bling Bling | 8-3    | 1             | 86-35        | 1972.96    | 179.36 | 16.91              |

| Team        | 1      | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5      | 6     | Playoff Chance |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | -------------: |
| Bling Bling | 83.10% | 0.47% | 0.60% | 0.19% | 13.43% | 2.21% |         99.99% |

Their most likely path to the playoffs is pretty straightforward. Win this week, and they've pretty much done it. They face division rival Not Lucky this week, so a win this week means they quash their biggest divisional threat. Even if the Wolverines win their matchup against Total domination, the point lead Bling Bling has on the Wolverines (113.82) is so large that it is extremely unlikely the Wolverines would be able to bridge that gap after Week 13.

### Not Lucky (95.83%)

| Team Name | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Not Lucky | 7-4    | 2             | 73-48        | 1944.52    | 176.77 | 14.32              |

| Team      | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5      | 6      | Playoff Chance |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ | -------------: |
| Not Lucky | 9.64% | 0.24% | 0.34% | 0.10% | 46.47% | 39.04% |         95.83% |

While a division seed is definitely possible, it's not very likely at this point. Not Lucky has a couple very difficult matchups coming up the next couple weeks against their division rivals. Lucky for them, their position in the PF rankings mean if they don't manage to get the #5 seed, they'll probably get the #6. Other teams will be watching Not Lucky closely to see where they fall, since that has implications for other teams currently in the race.

### speed-demons (92.31%)

| Team Name    | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| speed-demons | 7-4    | 1             | 69-52        | 1854.28    | 168.57 | 6.12               |

| Team         | 1     | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5     | 6     | Playoff Chance |
| ------------ | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------------: |
| speed-demons | 0.83% | 39.53% | 33.87% | 17.87% | 0.00% | 0.23% |         92.31% |

The speed-demons need only win one of the next two matchups to block the Tricksters out of a divisional seed. Lucky for them, they have the Golden Eagles in Week 13, a team that has looked _very_ beatable.

### Kali Warriors (76.25%)

| Team Name     | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Kali Warriors | 6-5    | 2             | 78-43        | 1912.70    | 173.88 | 11.43              |

| Team          | 1     | 2     | 3      | 4     | 5     | 6      | Playoff Chance |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| Kali Warriors | 0.01% | 9.58% | 14.70% | 9.03% | 4.23% | 38.70% | 76.25%         |

It's been a rough couple of weeks for the Kali Warriors. Speaking as the team's owner, when my star DL Myles Garrett bludgeoned Mason Rudolph with his own helmet, it felt like he was doing that to me. Or rather, my playoff dreams. While a playoff berth is far from out of the realm of possibility, that particular loss hurt pretty badly.

There are a few scenarios in which KW makes the playoffs:

- Total domination loses their next two games, and Kali Warriors wins at least one.
  - Fortunately for KW, they face the Red Warriors this week, so a win is pretty likely.
  - Unfortunately for KW, Total domination _also_ faces the Red Warriors, except in two weeks.
- KW wins out, and Total domination loses one of the next two games.
  - Tough proposition for the Warriors, who face Bling Bling in two weeks.
- KW gets a wildcard seed.
  - Sitting at #3 in Points For on the season really helps their chances. If Not Lucky gets the #5 seed, KW would be the current recipient for #6. If they can manage to bridge the 28.44-point gap between themselves and Not Lucky, they'd get the #6 seed no matter what.

### Total domination (66.68%)

| Team Name        | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Total domination | 7-4    | 1             | 55-66        | 1760.84    | 160.08 | -2.38              |

| Team             | 1     | 2     | 3      | 4      | 5     | 6     | Playoff Chance |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------------: |
| Total domination | 0.57% | 8.97% | 19.33% | 37.81% | 0.00% | 0.00% |         66.68% |

The entirety of Total domination's playoff chances depend on securing the divisional title. The odds of accomplishing that are pretty good at this point, after a key Week 11 victory.

All they need to do at this point to win the division is to win as many games as division rival Kali Warriors does in the remaining weeks of the season. Their only shot at winning the division is to make sure they remain a game ahead of Kali Warriors, since their PF is substantially lower than KW's.

### Detroit Wolverines (48.99%)

| Team Name          | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Detroit Wolverines | 7-4    | 3             | 72-49        | 1860.64    | 169.15 | 6.70               |

| Team               | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5      | 6     | Playoff Chance |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | -------------: |
| Detroit Wolverines | 4.63% | 0.65% | 0.05% | 0.00% | 35.87% | 7.79% |         48.99% |

If the Wolverines are the Cinderella story of this season, does that make Not Lucky their fairy godmother? 🤔 Of course, Dalvin Cook isn't the sole reason for their success, but it would be fair to say he's the team's MVP.

Despite the Wolverines' tremendous recent success, they're still on an uncertain path to the playoffs. Their best shot at a playoff seed is securing the #5 wildcard seed.

Their biggest competition for that seed are:
- Total domination (7-4)
  - DW probably wants TD to win their division, since DW is currently a game ahead of the Kali Warriors (6-5) and should be able to maintain that lead.
- Kali Warriors
  - DW just needs to win as many games as KW does to maintain the lead on them.
- Not Lucky
  - Given the large PF lead NL has on DW, DW needs to win one more game than NL does.
  - DW should be able to win their matchup this week against Total domination, while NL has a tougher matchup against Bling Bling. If DW gets a game ahead of NL this week, they would just need to beat NL in Week 13.
- speed-demons
  - DW wants the speed-demons to win their division, which is a pretty likely prospect.
- Tricksters
  - The Tricksters are only a threat if they win out and DW loses out. Unlikely threat.

### Tricksters (19.96%)

| Team Name  | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Tricksters | 5-6    | 2             | 73-48        | 1869.48    | 169.95 | 7.50               |

| Team       | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6      | Playoff Chance |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | -------------: |
| Tricksters | 0.00% | 0.01% | 0.81% | 7.10% | 0.00% | 12.04% |         19.96% |

It's been a tough past few weeks for the Tricksters. Right now, their outlook for the postseason is pretty grim.

Here are their playoff scenarios:
- They beat speed-demons this week, and the speed-demons lose to the Golden Eagles next week.
  - Winning this week is very doable, but it's difficult to count on the Golden Eagles winning right now.
- Not Lucky gets the #5 seed, and the Tricksters bridge the 31.82-point gap between themselves and the Kali Warriors.

It doesn't look good, but as always, anything can happen!

## Luck Chart

![](/post-assets/2019/2019-11-21/luck.png){:.rounded}

This pretty much tracks with how team luck has felt. The Tricksters have gotten the short end of the stick in terms of luck; they lead the league in Points Against, and given their overall wins, their record _should_ be somewhere between 6 and 7 wins. Losing even one game unfairly really hurts them, since that one game is the difference between a more probable divisional title and missing the playoffs entirely.

The Winged Hussars are the unluckiest team, but at this point, that's probably circled back to being lucky, given that this helps his draft position next year.

Good luck in Week 12!
