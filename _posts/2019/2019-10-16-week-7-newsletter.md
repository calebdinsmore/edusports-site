## Weekly Status Update

### Current Playoff Seeds

If the playoff seeds were calculated today, here's who would make the cut.

| Seed | Team Name        | Criteria                                  |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1st  | Bling Bling      | Division winner with best record\*        |
| 2nd  | Kali Warriors    | Division winner with second-best record\* |
| 3rd  | Pegasus          | Division winner with third-best record\*  |
| 4th  | Tricksters       | Division winner with worst record\*       |
| 5th  | Total domination | Team with best record among remaining\*   |
| 6th  | Not Lucky        | Team with most points for among remaining |

\*Ties broken by **Points For**.

The Kali Warriors moved up a seed, barely beating Pegasus in Points For. Not Lucky lost their hold on the 5th seed but still has a solid grip on the 6th with a Points For that is 65.98 points higher than the next highest non-seed scorer, speed-demons. After their showing this week and their remarkable trade giving up Dalvin Cook this week, though, that hold might be slipping.

### Title Belt

Team **Not Lucky** has `lost`{:.error} the title belt to team **Total domination**!

**Total domination** will be defending the title from the **Tricksters** in this week's upcoming matchup.

### Scoring by Division

| Rank | Division Name    | Points For | Wins | Average PPG |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1    | Division By Zero | 3149.12    | 11   | 174.95      |
| 2    | Cerberus         | 2820.20    | 9    | 156.68      |
| 3    | The Resistance   | 2987.86    | 8    | 165.99      |
| 4    | High Flyers      | 2910.58    | 8    | 161.70      |

Cerberus still trails in Points For, but adding a couple wins to their total this past week puts them at #2!

After a devastating week during which every member of the High Flyers lost, they fall down to the bottom of the divisional standings.

### Overall Wins by Week

| Team                | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 |

| Not Lucky           | 9-2    | 9-2    | 11-0   | 2-9    | 6-5    | 1-10   |
| Detroit Wolverines  | 1-10   | 0-11   | 1-10   | 8-3    | 7-4    | 11-0   |
| Pegasus             | 11-0   | 6-5    | 10-1   | 9-2    | 4-7    | 0-11   |
| Golden Eagles       | 6-5    | 1-10   | 2-9    | 3-8    | 10-1   | 4-7    |
| Winged Hussars      | 3-8    | 8-3    | 6-5    | 4-7    | 1-10   | 3-8    |

Last week I said the gap between Pegasus and Kali Warriors could be bridged in a single week, and it just barely happened. After putting up the lowest score in Week 6, Pegasus drops to #4 in Points For.

#### Max Points For

| Rank | Team Name           | Max PF  |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------- |
| 1    | Not Lucky           | 1410.94 |

| 3    | Kali Warriors       | 1349.82 |
| 4    | Detroit Wolverines  | 1332.34 |
| 5    | Tricksters          | 1330.36 |
| 6    | Bling Bling         | 1307.86 |
| 7    | Winged Hussars      | 1213.06 |
| 8    | Pegasus             | 1211.70 |
| 9    | The Death Eaters    | 1175.62 |

| 11   | Necessary Roughness | 1130.66 |
| 12   | Red Warriors        | 1075.70 |

### Manager Ranking

| 1    | Pegasus             | 1058.40    | 1211.70 | 87.35%        | 1      |
| 2    | Bling Bling         | 1129.38    | 1307.86 | 86.35%        | -1     |
| 3    | The Death Eaters    | 990.84     | 1175.62 | 84.28%        | 0      |
| 4    | Necessary Roughness | 922.40     | 1130.66 | 81.58%        | 2      |
| 5    | Golden Eagles       | 932.42     | 1153.00 | 80.87%        | -1     |
| 6    | Tricksters          | 1055.96    | 1330.36 | 79.37%        | 1      |
| 7    | Kali Warriors       | 1061.24    | 1349.82 | 78.62%        | -2     |
| 8    | Not Lucky           | 1075.48    | 1410.94 | 76.22%        | 0      |
| 9    | Winged Hussars      | 919.76     | 1213.06 | 75.82%        | 0      |
| 10   | speed-demons        | 1009.50    | 1356.38 | 74.43%        | 0      |
| 11   | Red Warriors        | 768.12     | 1075.70 | 71.41%        | 1      |
| 12   | Detroit Wolverines  | 944.26     | 1332.34 | 70.87%        | -1     |

Pegasus's ascension to the #1 spot in managerial effectiveness is bitter-sweet; their manager score was bumped after a week when they put up the lowest score while at the same time being the most efficient with their starting lineup. Not a fun combination.

```

The most striking change this week as seen in the table and chart above is Not Lucky's dramatic plunge from #3 to #7. There are two main contributing factors to this change:

- Not Lucky put up the second-lowest score last week at 120.52. This crippled their overall win record and consistency metric.
- They very recently made a blockbuster trade, selling their stud RB Dalvin Cook for Jordan Howard, Kirk Cousins, and a 2020 1st. This left them respectable at RB but not nearly as intimidating as they were before.

That trade left me scratching my head somewhat. Not Lucky has been a legitimate serious contender, and while they still are, they've seriously hurt their chances at a win this year. And while they got a nice pick out of it, the value of that pick drops the more the Detroit Wolverines win (since pick order is determined by a team's success). And the Wolverines are looking to have a few more wins in store after that haul.

## ROS Roster Rankings Over Time

Here's a chart I thought I'd include as well. This is how the ROS Ranking of each team has changed over the course of the season.

        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Notes on this chart:

- The Winged Hussars' W4=>W5 fall correlated to their trade with the Golden Eagles, when they gave up JuJu, Ertz, and Michel in exchange for Watkins, DeMarcus Lawrence, and some decent picks. This plunged them into #12 ROS territory, where they've lived since.
- There is an obvious correlation between the recent Dalvin Cook trade and Not Lucky's and the Detroit Wolverines' ROS switcheroo.
- There is a ton of movement in the early weeks because most of the rankings are speculative. The rankings start to settle down once we've actually seen players play and get a feel for actual strength of schedules and whatnot.

## Team-by-Team Breakdown

### Bling Bling (1)

| Team Name   | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Bling Bling | 6-0    | 1             | 55-11        | 1129.38    | 188.23 |

Another week, another blurb about how Bling Bling is utterly wrecking the league in almost every metric.

They take on Necessary Roughness this week, so here's to their upcoming 7-0 record. 🍻

### Kali Warriors (2)

| Team Name     | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Kali Warriors | 4-2    | 1             | 44-22        | 1061.24    | 176.87 |

After a solid Week 6 performance, Kali Warriors climbs two spots to the #2. Fairly consistent so far this season, the Warriors face their toughest week of byes, missing most notably CMC, OBJ, Myles Garrett (DL), and Lavonte David (LB).

The matchup against the Winged Hussars shouldn't be too rough, but I wouldn't be surprised at a loss this week.

### Tricksters (3)

| Team Name  | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Tricksters | 4-2    | 1             | 42-24        | 1055.96    | 175.99 |

The Tricksters also climbed two spots to the #3 position. They have scored well fairly consistently, only scoring in the bottom half of the league twice.

This week they face Total domination, which could prove to be a tough matchup for them. I'll be watching that game closely.

### Pegasus (4)

| Team Name | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Pegasus   | 4-2    | 1             | 40-26        | 1058.40    | 176.40 |

Pegasus comes down to earth a bit after dropping two places to #4 this week after a very rough showing last week.

They play the Red Warriors this week, which should be a win for them, but I'm anticipating a narrow victory if they do pull one out. Pegasus should be worried; if they want to hold on to that division lead, they might want to make some moves to shore up their depth.

### Total domination (5)

| Team Name        | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| The Death Eaters | 4-2    | 2             | 32-34        | 990.84     | 165.14 |

Trailing the four division leaders is Total domination, a team that has managed to remain in contention despite only barely outscoring the league average (+0.3 points) and scoring in the bottom half of the league in 5 out of 6 weeks.

They have the same record as their division leader the Kali Warriors, but they trail them in Points For by 70.4 points. It's a close race, and anything could happen.

### speed-demons (6)

| Team Name    | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| speed-demons | 3-3    | 2             | 34-32        | 1009.50    | 168.25 |

The speed-demons have reversed their downward slope in power rankings, climbing back up to #6. They have had a very up-and-down season, scoring in the top-25% one week and the bottom-30% the next, over and over.

This week they face the Detroit Wolverines, a team that has made themselves quite the formidable opponent. I'm anticipating a pretty significant loss this week for the demons.

### Not Lucky (7)

| Team Name | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Not Lucky | 3-3    | 2             | 38-28        | 1075.48    | 179.25 |

After a very rough week and a trade that exchanged current contention for future potential, Not Lucky finds themselves down in the bottom half of the power rankings for the first time since Week 1.

Their future this season is murkier now; their best shot at a playoff berth is a wild card seed, and their grasp on that is slipping as we enter the second half of the regular season. They play the Golden Eagles this week, which should mean another win for them, but it's still a long road to Week 14.

### Golden Eagles (8)

| Team Name     | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Golden Eagles | 3-3    | 2             | 26-40        | 932.42     | 155.40 |

The Golden Eagles continue to sit at #8, not quite managing to break out of the rut they're developing.

They have obviously committed to contending this year, but they have only scored in the top half of the league twice, most often finding themselves in the bottom-third. There is still plenty of season left, and Pegasus seems to be coming down to earth, but whether it'll be enough for the Golden Eagles to secure a playoff berth is very uncertain.

### Detroit Wolverines (9)

| Team Name          | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Detroit Wolverines | 2-4    | 3             | 28-38        | 944.26     | 157.38 |

The Wolverines' trade for Cook this week came as a surprise from a team that didn't really look to be in the running for playoff contention. Right now, the Wolverines' best shot at a playoff berth is one of the two wild card seeds. The 6th seed is currently pretty out of reach for them; they're behind Not Lucky (the current seed-holder) by 131.22 points. They could definitely bridge that gap, but that seems unlikely.

Their best shot is the 5th seed, as they are only two wins and 46.58 points behind Total domination, the current 5th seed-holder.

Right now things don't look great for them, but if they can continue to make moves like the one they made yesterday, they're not out of the running yet.

### Necessary Roughness (10)

| Team Name           | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Necessary Roughness | 1-5    | 3             | 21-45        | 922.40     | 153.73 |

Rough week for Necessary Roughness, losing by just over a point to the Kali Warriors. They have flip-flopped between #10 and #11 for the past four weeks, this week finding themselves back at #10.

This week they face the most dominant team in the league, so it's shaping up to be another not-so-fun week.

### Winged Hussars (11)

| Team Name      | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Winged Hussars | 1-5    | 3             | 25-41        | 919.76     | 153.29 |

The Hussars dropped another two places in the power rankings this week after another poor performance in Week 6. They need not worry about claiming #12, though--the gap between #11 and #12 is still pretty wide. They seem to be in rebuild mode, which is wise at this point given their record and performance.

### Red Warriors (12)

| Team Name    | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Red Warriors | 1-5    | 3             | 11-55        | 768.12     | 128.02 |

Lastly, we have the Red Warriors. There isn't much to say about this team that hasn't been said. I see them maintaining their position for the rest of the season, in decent shape for a bounce back next year after the rookie draft.

This week's luckiest team is Total domination, with about 1 win more than their overall wins would suggest they deserve.

The Winged Hussars continue to be the unluckiest team this week.

The Kali Warriors and Red Warriors are right where they belong.
