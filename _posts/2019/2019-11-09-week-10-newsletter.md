Only movement in Points For this week was the Detroit Wolverines scoring just enough to take the #5 spot. This is significant, since this gives the Wolverines the #6 playoff seed (if the playoffs started next week). The race is tight, and the Wolverines are looking to widen that gap between themselves and the speed-demons as the playoffs approach.

### Observations

The most notable shake-up in the power rankings is Bling Bling losing the #1 spot after seven straight weeks holding it. The Kali Warriors threatened Bling's throne for three weeks before finally managing to barely earn the #1 spot.

After suffering a tough loss against a team they were projected to win against (Pegasus), Total domination has falled three spots down to #8, undoing weeks of climbing the ranks to #5.

Total domination's departure from the top-6 sees Not Lucky welcomed back into the fold, after a solid Week 9 performance.

## Playoff Probabilities

### Methodology

I took the upcoming schedule and ran it through a Monte Carlo simulation, simulating 100,000 different regular season outcomes.

It's not sophisticated; it doesn't factor in upcoming BYE weeks or consider the different matchups players on each roster have that might produce extraordinary games.

Here's what it does right now:

- Takes each team and computes a truncated mean and standard deviation for their point totals scored throughout the season.
  - I'm truncating the scores by removing each team's lowest and highest score from the mean.
- Goes through each week and simulates a matchup by generating a random score for each team in the matchup. This random score is generated assuming a normal distribution and is based on the truncated mean and standard deviation for the team.
- After simulating the rest of the season, it calculates the playoff seeding for the results and records them.

Since it doesn't take future BYE weeks into account that would potentially factor into future upsets, it's obviously not a perfect simulation. But it **does** give you an idea for how difficult your coming schedule is.

### Probability Table

Ordered by probability.

Quick note:

- **Change** is the change in each team's Playoff Chance compared to when this was run last week.

#### Observations

- After losing a favored matchup against Pegasus, Total domination's chances at a playoff run dropped significantly. Without enough points to contend for the #6 wild card spot, their best shot is looking to be the 5th seed, which is itself unlikely.
- On the other side, after a well-timed upset, Pegasus is looking good on top of their very poorly performing division. The 4th seed is looking well within their grasp.
- I find it hilarious that despite the Winged Hussars being 1-8, they still have a .02% chance at winning their division. They would need to win the next four games, and Pegasus would need to lose the next four games for that to happen.
- The Detroit Wolverines and the speed-demons will be the most interesting to watch these next four weeks; their playoff chances seem the most up-in-the-air.
