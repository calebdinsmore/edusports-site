### Observations

Two significant shake-ups happened after Week 8:

- The Detroit Wolverines and Not Lucky switched places, with the Wolverines rocketing up 4 places to #4 and Not Lucky plummeting back down 4 places to #8.
- Less dramatically, Necessary Roughness and Pegasus also switched places, with Necessary Roughness climbing 2 places to #7 and Pegasus dropping 2 down to #9.

Adding to that, Not Lucky and Pegasus are the first top-7 team since Week 5 to drop below #7. It's definitely been a rocky past few weeks for them.

The Red Warriors have managed to barely pull themselves out of the depths of #12--and I mean barely. The difference between the Warriors and the Hussars in terms of the score I calculate to determine PR is _very_ small. They've managed this mostly by luck; despite their 130PPG and only getting **_seven_** overall wins in the last five weeks, they did manage to defy the odds and get two _actual_ wins in that time frame, putting their record at an improbable 3-5. The Hussars have just barely managed to do worse than them, which at least bodes well for their 2020 draft position!

### Observations

- Not Lucky has continued to sink, dropping to their lowest ROS Roster ranking of the season at #10. This largely comes as a result of Ekeler's diminished performance in the wake of Gordon's return (despite looking like a much better back for the Chargers), as well as Coleman's return hurting Breida's ROS outlook.

## Playoff Probabilities - New Segment!

This week I cooked up a script to simulate the rest of the regular season to give a rough idea of everyone's odds at making a playoff run given their upcoming Weeks 9-13 schedule.

### Methodology

I took the upcoming schedule and ran it through a Monte Carlo simulation, simulating 100,000 different regular season outcomes.

It's not sophisticated; it doesn't factor in upcoming BYE weeks or consider the different matchups players on each roster have that might produce extraordinary games.

Here's what it does right now:

- Takes each team and computes a truncated mean and standard deviation for their point totals scored throughout the season.
  - I'm truncating the scores by removing each team's lowest and highest score from the mean.
- Goes through each week and simulates a matchup by generating a random score for each team in the matchup. This random score is generated assuming a normal distribution and is based on the truncated mean and standard deviation for the team.
- After simulating the rest of the season, it calculates the playoff seeding for the results and records them.

Since it doesn't take future BYE weeks into account that would potentially factor into future upsets, it's obviously not a perfect simulation. But it **does** give you an idea for how difficult your coming schedule is.

### Observations

- Pegasus is favored to take the High Flyers division, but it'll be interesting to see how that actually plays out. Their early success is obviously a big factor in their simulated success, so we'll have to see if they manage to get back on their feet for the home stretch. Looking at their upcoming schedule, the deciding matchup will likely be their face-off against each other in Week 12, assuming they both win against the Hussars (good assumption) and lose their tougher matchups (GE vs. KW and PEG vs. TRIC).
- Division by Zero is going to be really interesting to watch. Bling Bling and Not Lucky are both projected to easily make the playoffs, and the Detroit Wolverines aren't ruled out either--they currently sit at around a 40% chance to make it in via a wild card seed. If they can pull off an upset against the Kali Warriors in Week 10 or against their division rivals in Weeks 11 and 13, that'll be huge for their chances.

## Team-by-Team Breakdown

### Bling Bling (1)

| Team Name   | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Bling Bling | 7-1    | 1             | 71-17        | 1511.30    | 188.91 | 24.85              |

Bling Bling is just unfair. Their Week 8 starting QB was Teddy Bridgewater, a guy who didn't even start and ended up putting up negative points, and Bling Bling _still_ put up 200+ points and had the highest score for the week--second highest score in the league on the season.

Bling Bling plays the speed-demons this week, and I'm fairly confident it'll be another W for BB.

### Kali Warriors (2)

| Team Name     | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Kali Warriors | 5-3    | 1             | 59-29        | 1417.90    | 177.24 | 13.17              |

After a decisive victory over the declining Not Lucky, the Kali Warriors are back on top of their division. Total domination is nipping at their heels, but the Warriors have a significant Points For margin ahead of TD. As long as the Warriors can keep up the wins, they should be able to make it out ahead of TD in the division. But fantasy is a cruel mistress, and a couple unfortunate upsets could turn the tables really quickly.

### Tricksters (3)

| Team Name  | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Tricksters | 4-4    | 1             | 53-35        | 1364.38    | 170.55 | 6.48               |

In a fun turn of events, the entire Resistance division is 4-4, and among mediocrity, the Tricksters reign supreme. Theirs is a very fun division to watch--the division title is easily within every member's grasp. At this point, though, given their performance to date, it's difficult to see anyone taking the division title over the Tricksters when all is said and done.

This week the Tricksters face an easy matchup against the Winged Hussars, while the speed-demons and Necessary Roughness face much tougher foes: Bling Bling and Not Lucky, respectively. A key upset this week would put either divisional rival in a good position in the race for Resistance glory.

### Detroit Wolverines (4)

| Team Name          | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Detroit Wolverines | 4-4    | 3             | 45-43        | 1325.24    | 165.66 | 1.59               |

What a turnaround for the Wolverines. In weeks 3 and 4, they were ranked dead last and were looking like the worst team in the league. Over the past few weeks they have been dominant, notching up 43 overall wins, which is the second in the league for that time frame.

The unfortunate part for the Wolverines is that their only real hope at a playoff berth is securing a wild card seed. The Division by Zero title is all but secured in the hands of Bling Bling. As they ascend the Points For ranks, that 6th seed is looking more and more attainable, and there is a decent chance that every member of Division by Zero makes it into the playoffs.

### Total domination (5)

| Team Name        | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Total domination | 5-3    | 2             | 42-46        | 1304.10    | 163.01 | -1.05              |

Total domination's win streak came to an end in Week 8, as they lost to Bling Bling pretty handily. Bad luck can't really be blamed for the loss either, as their Week 8 overall win record was a sad `2-9`.

This week is looking up for them, though, as they face Pegasus, a team that hasn't looked formidable since Week 4. However, they'll need the Golden Eagles to pull out an upset against the Kali Warriors this week if they want to get back on top of the division.

### speed-demons (6)

| Team Name    | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| speed-demons | 4-4    | 2             | 46-42        | 1337.36    | 167.17 | 3.10               |

The speed-demons have had a very average season so far, and fortunately for them, so has their division. They're the most immediate threat to the Tricksters' divisional lead, and as the trade deadline appears over the horizon, it might be time to decide whether to make a move and commit to contention or to let the chips fall how they may.

### Necessary Roughness (7)

| Team Name           | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Necessary Roughness | 4-4    | 3             | 41-47        | 1310.76    | 163.85 | -0.22              |

At #7, Necessary Roughness is at their highest point in the power rankings all season.

Their outlook this season is bleak, sitting at a 16.79% chance to make the playoffs. They'll need to make some key upsets in order to secure the divisional title, so it's time for them to take stock of their situation and either make moves to better their odds or start looking to the future and crossing their fingers for some lucky breaks.

### Not Lucky (8)

| Team Name | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Not Lucky | 4-4    | 2             | 50-38        | 1416.78    | 177.10 | 13.03              |

It's been so up-and-down for Not Lucky this season. At #8, they're at the lowest point they've been so far.

Their overall team performance and points scored on the season puts them in a great position to secure a playoff run, but their consistency as of late has been all over the place. With some crucial BYEs coming up (Fournette, Lockett, etc.), there's some real worry for Not Lucky moving forward, especially with the Wolverines quickly approaching from behind.

### Pegasus (9)

| Team Name | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Pegasus   | 4-4    | 1             | 42-46        | 1297.20    | 162.15 | -1.91              |

Pegasus has continued to decline this week, dropping two more places to #9. They have a tenuous hold on their division, but fortunately for them, their division is incredibly weak. They've suffered some depth issues with injuries and BYEs, so hopefully the for them the worst has passed. If so, they have a good chance at a playoff berth. How far they get in the playoffs is another matter entirely.

### Golden Eagles (10)

| Team Name     | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Golden Eagles | 3-5    | 2             | 35-53        | 1248.44    | 156.06 | -8.01              |

The Golden Eagles have an uphill battle to the playoffs. It's a shallow hill, but it's uphill nonetheless. They've shown flashes of greatness but have been pretty inconsistent. If they hope to secure a playoff berth, they'll need a few more flashes of greatness.

### Red Warriors (11)

| Team Name    | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Red Warriors | 3-5    | 3             | 16-72        | 1042.54    | 130.32 | -33.75             |

### Winged Hussars (12)

| Team Name      | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Winged Hussars | 1-7    | 3             | 28-60        | 1174.24    | 146.78 | -17.29             |

At this point are the Winged Hussars really _unlucky_? Being at the bottom of the league bodes well for next year's draft!
