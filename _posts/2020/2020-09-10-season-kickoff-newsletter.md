## Title Belt Refresher

The **Tricksters** have held the title belt for 5 straight weeks, carrying it into the championship. This week they defend it from none other than **Necessary Roughness**.

## Team Power Rankings by the "Experts"

Based on FantasyPros' expert aggregator, here's how our teams stack up after the draft.

| Rank | Team                | Score | Grade |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1    | Kali Warriors       | 100   | A+    |
| 2    | Tricksters          | 99    | A+    |
| 3    | Bling Bling         | 92    | A-    |
| 4    | Detroit Wolverines  | 87    | B     |
| 5    | Necessary Roughness | 84    | B     |
| 6    | Red Warriors        | 83    | B-    |
| 7    | Not Lucky           | 82    | B-    |
| 8    | Speed-Demons        | 80    | B-    |
| 9    | Pegasus             | 80    | B-    |
| 10   | Winged Hussars      | 78    | C+    |
| 11   | Total Domination    | 73    | C-    |
| 12   | Golden Eagles       | 65    | D     |

### Notes

- Of course, take these rankings with the grainiest of grains of salt, as we don't know much of anything about the rookies this year, and they seem to be perpetually down on Pegasus, despite that team performing reasonably strongly last season, barely getting beaten out by the Tricksters in the championship. I give their rankings a relatively low weighting in my Power Ranking calculations, but at this point it's all we have to go off of. So suck it nerds, I'm better than all of you

## Matchup Preview

### Kali Warriors vs. Red Warriors

**Projected Winner**

|               | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Kali Warriors | 93%           | 96.5%             |

Last year, the Red Warriors played a key role in keeping Kali Warriors from a playoff berth in the home stretch of the season, so KW is out for revenge.

### Total Domination vs. speed-demons

**Projected Winner**

|              | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| speed-demons | 85%           | 80.9%             |

Not much to say here. speed-demons are the favorites by a wide margin, and a win here would even the score between themselves and Total Domination.

### Tricksters vs. Necessary Roughness (Title Belt Match)

**Projected Winner**

|            | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Tricksters | 78%           | 80.6%             |

The reigning champs are undefeated against their division, and this week is looking to continue that streak (and the current longest Title Belt streak held by the Tricksters).

### Bling Bling vs. Detroit Wolverines

**Projected Winner**

|                    | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Bling Bling        | 59%           | 24.2%             |
| Detroit Wolverines | 41%           | 75.8%             |

Arguably _the_ rivalry in Division by Zero, this matchup could truly go either way. Both teams are very strong, and each of them has beaten the other once (in the regular season), for a 50% win-loss percentage. I'll be watching this closely to see who pulls out ahead in this bout of rivals.

### Golden Eagles vs. Pegasus
