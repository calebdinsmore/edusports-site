# Announcements

## Official Congratulations

First off, official congratulations are long overdue for the 2019 season champions, the Tricksters! The championship game against Pegasus ended up being extremely close, but after barely claiming the 6th seed, the Tricksters swept through the playoffs and claimed their title.

## New Records Page

I've added a new [Records](/misc/records.html) page to the nav bar, where you'll find various records/all-time stats from the league, including league and divisional champions, most PF in a season, most points scored in a single game, and head-to-head records for each team (so you can see how you've performed against every other team throughout the seasons).

## Title Belt Refresher

The **Tricksters** have held the title belt for 5 straight weeks, carrying it into the championship. This week they defend it from none other than **Necessary Roughness**.

## Team Power Rankings by the "Experts"

Based on FantasyPros' expert aggregator, here's how our teams stack up after the draft.

| Rank | Team                | Score | Grade |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1    | Kali Warriors       | 100   | A+    |
| 2    | Tricksters          | 99    | A+    |
| 3    | Bling Bling         | 92    | A-    |
| 4    | Detroit Wolverines  | 87    | B     |
| 5    | Necessary Roughness | 84    | B     |
| 6    | Red Warriors        | 83    | B-    |
| 7    | Not Lucky           | 82    | B-    |
| 8    | Speed-Demons        | 80    | B-    |
| 9    | Pegasus             | 80    | B-    |
| 10   | Winged Hussars      | 78    | C+    |
| 11   | The Death Eaters    | 73    | C-    |
| 12   | Golden Eagles       | 65    | D     |

### Notes

- Of course, take these rankings with the grainiest of grains of salt, as we don't know that much about the rookies this year, and they seem to be perpetually down on Pegasus, despite that team performing reasonably strongly last season, barely getting beaten out by the Tricksters in the championship. I give their rankings a relatively low weighting in my Power Ranking calculations, but at this point it's all we have to go off of. ~~So suck it nerds, I'm better than all of you~~

## Matchup Preview

### Kali Warriors vs. Red Warriors

**Projected Winner**

|               | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Kali Warriors | 93%           | 96.5%             |

Last year, the Red Warriors played a key role in keeping Kali Warriors from a playoff berth in the home stretch of the season, so KW is out for revenge.

### The Death Eaters vs. speed-demons

**Projected Winner**

|              | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| speed-demons | 85%           | 80.9%             |

Not much to say here. speed-demons are the favorites by a wide margin, and a win here would even the score between themselves and The Death Eaters, who beat them in their sole matchup last season.

### Tricksters vs. Necessary Roughness (Title Belt Match)

**Projected Winner**

|            | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Tricksters | 78%           | 80.6%             |

The reigning champs are undefeated against their division, and this week is looking to continue that streak (and the current longest Title Belt streak held by the Tricksters).

### Bling Bling vs. Detroit Wolverines

**Projections**

|                    | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Bling Bling        | 59%           | 24.2%             |
| Detroit Wolverines | 41%           | 75.8%             |

Arguably _the_ rivalry in Division by Zero, this matchup could truly go either way. Both teams are very strong, and each of them has beaten the other once (in the regular season), for a 50% win-loss percentage. I'll be watching this closely to see who pulls out ahead in this bout of rivals.

### Golden Eagles vs. Pegasus

**Projected Winner**

|         | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Pegasus | 72%           | 92.3%             |

Pegasus is undefeated against the Golden Eagles, and that streak shows no signs of stopping this week. Golden Eagles' only significant positional advantages are at TE and DL, with Zach Ertz, Gronk, Nick Bosa, and Fletcher Cox in the lineup. It'll be interesting to see just how well Gronk plays given the pretty penny the Eagles spent on him.

### Winged Hussars vs. Not Lucky

**Projected Winner**

|           | Sleeper Win % | FantasyPros Win % |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Not Lucky | 87%           | 60%               |

Sleeper has Not Lucky winning this matchup by a decent margin, but it could be deceptively close. The Hussars are stronger on the defensive side of the ball (excepting Jamal Adams), and Not Lucky is stronger on the offensive side of the ball (mainly excepting Mahomes). Not Lucky won their sole matchup last season and looks to stay undefeated, but an upset here is certainly possible.
