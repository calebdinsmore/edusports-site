## Team Power Rankings by the "Experts"

Based on FantasyPros' expert aggregator, here's how our teams stack up after the draft.

| Rank | Team                | Score | Grade |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1    | Kali Warriors       | 100   | A+    |
| 2    | Tricksters          | 99    | A+    |
| 3    | Bling Bling         | 92    | A-    |
| 4    | Detroit Wolverines  | 87    | B     |
| 5    | Necessary Roughness | 84    | B     |
| 6    | Red Warriors        | 83    | B-    |
| 7    | Not Lucky           | 82    | B-    |
| 8    | Speed-Demons        | 80    | B-    |
| 9    | Pegasus             | 80    | B-    |
| 10   | Winged Hussars      | 78    | C+    |
| 11   | Total Domination    | 73    | C-    |
| 12   | Golden Eagles       | 65    | D     |

### Notes

- Of course, take these rankings with the grainiest of grains of salt, as we don't know much of anything about the rookies this year, and they seem to be perpetually down on Pegasus, despite that team performing reasonably strongly last season, barely getting beaten out by the Tricksters in the championship. I give their rankings a relatively low weighting in my Power Ranking calculations, but at this point it's all we have to go off of. So suck it nerds, I'm better than all of you
