Notes:

- After a very poor performance, Kali Warriors plunges further in the power rankings, despite sitting at 4-1. I wager luck may be running out for me, but we'll see what the next few weeks bring with McCaffrey's return soon and Alexander Mattison's temporary lead back role.
- Tricksters and Detroit Wolverines are battling for that top spot, but Tricksters' consistently lights-out performances mean that for the time being they have that #1 ranking on lock.
- Not Lucky has tanked down to #11, and they threaten to disrupt the Golden Eagles' 5-week streak of being at the bottom. We'll have to see who underperforms harder.
- Keep an eye on Winged Hussars; they've crept up the rankings and in terms of overall wins and PPG, they match their division leader, Pegasus.

Columns 1-6 represent each seed and the given team's chances of getting that particular seed.

Notes:

- While, of course, anything can happen, it's difficult to see this simulation being wrong about the Tricksters and Wolverines being locked in for a playoff berth. Even if one of them manages to lose their division, they also lead the rest of the league in Points For by a pretty wide margin, so at the very least they'd get a 6 seed, barring complete and total implosion in the upcoming weeks.
- The Red Warriors have surged up by 40% after a couple good performances on their part and a couple bad performances on division rival Kali Warriors' part.
- Pegasus is falling as the Winged Hussars slowly rise 👀

## Team Breakdowns by Division

### Cerberus

| Team Name        | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Red Warriors     | 4-1    | 1             | 29-26        | 834.58     | 166.92 | 3.87               |
| Kali Warriors    | 4-1    | 2             | 26-29        | 774.00     | 154.80 | -8.25              |
| The Death Eaters | 2-3    | 3             | 15-40        | 691.46     | 138.29 | -24.76             |

We are such a bad division. Luckiest division in the league, baby!

### The Resistance

| Team Name           | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Tricksters          | 4-1    | 1             | 44-11        | 1018.02    | 203.60 | 40.56              |
| Necessary Roughness | 2-3    | 2             | 23-32        | 792.94     | 158.59 | -4.46              |
| speed-demons        | 1-4    | 3             | 28-27        | 836.54     | 167.31 | 4.26               |

The Tricksters this year are a serious force to be reckoned with. Super Bowl hangover? Pfft.

I would say the rest of their division isn't great, but they still on average outperform Cerberus in PPG.

### Division by Zero

| Team Name          | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Detroit Wolverines | 4-1    | 1             | 45-10        | 924.44     | 184.89 | 21.84              |
| Bling Bling        | 2-3    | 2             | 33-22        | 859.06     | 171.81 | 8.76               |
| Not Lucky          | 1-4    | 3             | 18-37        | 713.72     | 142.74 | -20.30             |

Division by Zero isn't quite the powerhouse division it was last season, but the Detroit Wolverines are at least doing their part to uphold the division's fierce reputation. The Wolverines' turnaround since the league's inception has been exciting to watch; at one point early last season they were at the bottom of the Power Rankings for two straight weeks before climbing up and making the playoffs.

Now they look to be on a collision course with former champion the Tricksters in the postseason.

### The High Flyers

| Team Name      | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Pegasus        | 3-2    | 1             | 26-29        | 814.16     | 162.83 | -0.22              |
| Winged Hussars | 2-3    | 2             | 26-29        | 816.36     | 163.27 | 0.22               |
| Golden Eagles  | 1-4    | 3             | 17-38        | 707.62     | 141.52 | -21.52             |

Each week as I look at the sad state of the High Flyers division, I have to remind myself that Pegasus made it to the championship game last season and _nearly_ won. Once you're in the playoffs, all bets are off. Despite this division underperforming, whoever gets that coveted divisional seed very well may be this year's Super Bowl champs.

## Luck Chart

![](/post-assets/2020/2020-10-15/luck.png){:.rounded}

Cerberus tops the chart as the undisputed luckiest division in the league. The Tricksters' luck has bounced back to perfect balance, while division-mate speed-demons sits at the bottom with an unlucky 1-4 record.

Good luck in Week 6!
