Two games down, and we're starting to get a clearer picture of strength across the league. Let's dive into it!

## New Records

Last week saw a new broken record that I wanted to highlight.

### Least Points Scored in a Single Game

| Rank | Season | Team             | Score |
| ---- | ------ | ---------------- | ----- |
| 1    | 2020   | Total Domination | 83.3  |
| 2    | 2019   | Red Warriors     | 91.18 |

Total Domination set a new league record for least points scored in a game last week with an 83.3 after stat corrections. Woof.

Honorable mention: in the same week, the Golden Eagles scored the 3rd-lowest single game score at 96.28.

## Weekly Update

### Title Belt

The Tricksters successfully defended their title in Week 1, but after some key stat corrections on Thursday morning, the **Kali Warriors** broke their 6-game streak. The Kali Warriors look to defend it against division rival **Total Domination** in Week 3.

### Scoring by Division

| Rank | Division Name    | Points For | Wins | Average PPG |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1    | Division By Zero | 1003.00    | 4    | 167.17      |
| 2    | Cerberus         | 924.22     | 4    | 154.04      |
| 3    | The Resistance   | 1108.00    | 2    | 184.67      |
| 4    | High Flyers      | 852.66     | 2    | 142.11      |

Division by Zero was a powerhouse division last season, and they're starting off very strong this year, too, at least as far as actual wins are concerned. The Resistance might be low on wins, but they're dominating in Points For and Average PPG.

### Points Leaders

#### Points For

| Rank | Team Name           | Points For | Change | Points Behind Lead | Points Behind Next Rank |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |

| 9    | Not Lucky           | 306.12     | -5     | 109.56             | 20.66                   |
| 10   | Winged Hussars      | 283.82     | 2      | 131.86             | 22.30                   |
| 11   | Total Domination    | 240.00     | -4     | 175.68             | 43.82                   |
| 12   | Golden Eagles       | 221.58     | -1     | 194.10             | 18.42                   |

The Tricksters, who clinched the #6 seed last year (the one based on PF), is proving it wasn't a fluke and has started the season _incredibly_ strongly.

### Manager Ranking

Here's the current grade for each team based on how well they've managed their starting lineup throughout the season.

I know what you're thinking. "Wait, how is Kali still on top? His two starting RBs just went down!"

Yeah, it's kinda weird. Two main factors are contributing to that ranking:

1. My ROS Roster per FantasyPros is still second, but that primarily has to do with my defensive players, which are ranked highly. My positional strength at RB tanked from #1 to #9.
2. I'm one of three undefeated teams with a decent overall wins record, which both contribute significantly to Power Ranking (which is why Detroit is also up there).

I don't anticipate being up there for too long. But who knows? Fantasy is weird.

Interesting notes:

- 3 of the top 4 projected teams going into the season have roughly held position after a couple weeks. The exception being Bling Bling, who after a rough Week 1 plummeted to the 9th position before rebounding a bit back up to 6.
- The speed-demons have climbed the most from their starting position after an impressive Week 2, going from #10 to #4.

## Team Breakdowns by Division

### Cerberus

| Team Name        | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Kali Warriors    | 2-0    | 1             | 16-6         | 350.72     | 175.36 | 13.37              |
| Red Warriors     | 1-1    | 2             | 11-11        | 333.50     | 166.75 | 4.75               |
| Total Domination | 1-1    | 3             | 5-17         | 240.00     | 120.00 | -42.00             |

The two teams of warriors have started the year pretty well relative to the rest of the league, and certainly relative to division-mate Total Domination, who at least has a win under their belt.

### The Resistance

| Team Name           | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Tricksters          | 1-1    | 1             | 17-5         | 415.68     | 207.84 | 45.85              |
| speed-demons        | 1-1    | 2             | 15-7         | 365.54     | 182.77 | 20.77              |
| Necessary Roughness | 0-2    | 3             | 9-13         | 326.78     | 163.39 | 1.39               |

The Resistance is the only division where every member is performing above the league average. I don't want to spoil the luck chart below, but as a division, they've really gotten the short end of the stick in the luck department, with Tricksters and speed-demons just barely losing their non-divisional games.

### Division by Zero

| Team Name          | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Detroit Wolverines | 2-0    | 1             | 18-4         | 354.22     | 177.11 | 15.12              |
| Bling Bling        | 1-1    | 2             | 12-10        | 342.66     | 171.33 | 9.33               |
| Not Lucky          | 1-1    | 3             | 10-12        | 306.12     | 153.06 | -8.94              |

Unlike The Resistance, DBZ has won both of their non-divisional matchups in weeks 1 and 2, which puts them ahead in terms of actual wins, despite not being anywhere close to The Resistance points-wise. It'll be interesting to see how the next several weeks turn out for these two divisions.

### The High Flyers

| Team Name      | Record | Division Rank | Overall Wins | Points For | PPG    | PPG vs. League AVG |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Pegasus        | 2-0    | 1             | 12-10        | 347.26     | 173.63 | 11.64              |
| Winged Hussars | 0-2    | 2             | 5-17         | 283.82     | 141.91 | -20.09             |
| Golden Eagles  | 0-2    | 3             | 2-20         | 221.58     | 110.79 | -51.21             |

The High Flyers are continuing last season's trend of _mostly_ not flying high. Pegasus continues to be the dominant team in the division, but among other division leaders, they stand at last in PPG. Last season taught us not to underestimate Pegasus, though, as they just barely missed the championship title. Even though their Overall Wins and Points For aren't the most impressive, a 2-0 record is a 2-0 record.

## Luck Chart

![](/post-assets/2020/2020-09-26/luck.png){:.rounded}

Ah, the luck chart. Even though the Tricksters aren't technically at the bottom, it feels like they're the real unlucky team, being 17-5 overall and a whopping 45.8 PPG above the league average. Outperforming every current undefeated team in the first two weeks, yet stands at 1-1.

Gotta love fantasy.
